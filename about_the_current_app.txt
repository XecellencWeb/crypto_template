the react app is runned with yarn as the package manager.
onces the app starts, a user needs to be authenticated to access the website features like bitcoin trading
there is also a protected kind of route to give users priviledges about for the app like the admin can do some things that users cant do.

problems with the app

the current problem with the app is that there is a backend section of the app which is needed for new users to be created but the backend api is not provided causing the app not to be able to direct a user well to the right page.
since the frontend as to send api request to the backend and currently now, it is being programmed to send request to a real server.


solution

To properly understand the app the backend url has to be provided so users can be created and functionalities added respectively.
